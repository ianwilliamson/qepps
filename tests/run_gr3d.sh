# This script provides a launcher for the 3D graphene waveguide model
# that can be run under an idev session on stampede
# 
# NOTE: Although this script will correctly resolve the location of the
# qepps exe and the lua configuration script, the lua script points to 
# data files at ./gr3d. This means that one should cd to the directory
# of this script (i.e. tests/) before executing this launcher. At some
# point in the future, referencing of the problem data from within
# LUA may be improved.

# Resolve the directory of this script
# taken from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/59895/can-a-bash-script-tell-what-directory-its-stored-in
