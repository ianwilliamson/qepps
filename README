**Quadratic Eigenvalue Problem Parameter-sweeper**

Loads matrices representing quadratic eigenvalue problem and solves 
```
(lambda^2*E+lambda*D+K)*U=0
```
where E, D, and K are matrices, U is a vector, and lambda is an eigenvalue. The matrix inputs (E, D, and K) are each be specified in components that can be combined in the form 

```
E=E0+p*E1+p^2*E2
```
where p is some problem parameter (NOT the eigenvalue). p represents some parameter that should be swept (typically frequency or the free-space wavevector k_0 in electromagnetics) and is specified as an ASCII file with one p value per line.

The code assembles the total E, D, and K matrices for each value of p and computes the eigenvector (typically mode's field pattern) and eigenvalue (typically the mode's complex effective index) closest to some specified target.
