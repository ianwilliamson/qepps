Quadratic Eigenvalue Problem Parameter-sweeper (QEPPS)
============================================================

Overview/background
--------------------------

Loads matrices representing quadratic eigenvalue problem and solves 

(lambda^2*E + lambda*D + K)*U = 0

where E, D, and K are matrices, U is a vector, and lambda is an eigenvalue. The matrix inputs (E, D, and K) are each be specified in components that can be combined in the form 

E = E0 + p*E1 + p^2*E2
D = D0 + p*D1 + p^2*D2
K = K0 + p*K1 + p^2*K2

where p is some problem parameter (NOT the eigenvalue). p represents some parameter that should be swept (typically frequency or the free-space wavevector ki0 in electromagnetics) and is specified as an ASCII file with one p value per line.

The code assembles the total E, D, and K matrices for each value of p and computes the eigenvector (typically mode's field pattern) and eigenvalue (typically the mode's complex effective index) closest to some specified target.
